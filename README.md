<h1>Comparative Study of CNN Architectures (VGG16, ResNet, EfficientNet) for Disease Prediction using Medical Images</h1>

This project presents a comparative study of three convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures—VGG16, ResNet18, and EfficientNet_B0—for the detection of pneumonia from chest X-ray images. Built using PyTorch, the project leverages transfer learning to fine-tune these pre-trained models on a labeled dataset of chest X-rays. The workflow includes preprocessing the dataset, training the models, evaluating their performance using accuracy, and visualizing the results through plots and confusion matrices. This repository aims to provide insights into how different CNN architectures perform on a real-world medical imaging task.
